# Authentication With PassportJS

## Introduction

In previous lessons, we learned how important it is to have your user managed (saved and retrieved) successfully. In this lab, you will do it one more time, just to make sure we are ready to move forward into new knowledge conquers :wink:
Overall, the goal is to understand how authentication and authorization work in a web applications, why these features are useful and to be able to implement signup and login features using Passport.

## Requirements

- Fork this repo
- Clone this repo

## Submission
- Upon completion, run the following commands:

```bash
git add .
git commit -m "done"
git push origin master
```
- Create Pull Request so your TAs can check up your work.

## Introductions

The starter-code provides the basic layout and organization for this assignment.

### Iteration 0 | Initialize the project

After forking and cloning the project, you will have to add a `starter_code/server/.env` file:

```
PORT=3001
```

And you have to install all the dependencies for both server and client:


```sh
$ cd starter_code/server
$ npm install
```
```
sh 
$ cd starter_code/client
$ npm install
```

Now you are ready to start ðŸš€

## Iteration #1: The Signup Feature

The repo you cloned comes with a `User` model and a `router` file already made for you. It also has all the views you need, although some are empty :smile:

Add a new route to your `passportRouter.js` file with the path `/signup` and point it to your `client/3000` frontend.

Now, in that signup component on your react client, add a form that makes a POST request to `/signup`, with a field for `username` and `password`.

Finally, add a POST route to your `passportRouter.js` to receive the data from the signup form and create a new user with the data.

Make sure you install **bcrypt** (or **bcryptjs**) and **passport** npm packages and require it in `passportRouter.js`.

## Iteration #2: The Login Feature

In order to add the login feature, let's add one GET route to our router to display the login page. `client/login-component` is empty so let's fill it with some login form. Once we have the form, let's add another route to the router to receive that data and log the user in. The form should make a POST request to `/login` in our server backend. 

**But Wait**

In order to do that, we need to configure Sessions and initialize a session with passport in our `app.js` file. We also need to add the `passport.serializeUser` functions as well as defining the Passport Local Strategy.

## Private Page

In the repo you forked, you must create a private view file called `private.js` in the `client folder`. This page is referenced in the `passportRouter.js` with the path `/private-page`. We use the `ensureLogin.ensureLoggedIn()` function to make sure that the user is logged in before viewing this page.

If everything worked correctly, the user should be able to sign up, login, and then visit the page, where they will receive a personalized greeting.

Happy coding! :heart:
